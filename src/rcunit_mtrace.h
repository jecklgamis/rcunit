/* The RCUNIT Memory Tracing Facility
 *  This is a simple pointer caching mechanism. Fundamentally, allocated
 *  pointers are cached (recorded) and uncached on deallocations. Any left
 *  pointers in the cache are considered leaks. Thus if a user assumes that
 *  a particular execution point all pointers are deallocated but there are
 *  left pointers in cache, then there is memory leak.
 *
 *  Below is the runtime memory layout of the pointer cache.
 *  RCU_POINTER_CACHE

 *      |   +-rcu_pointer_info[rcu_pointer_table_SIZE];
